# Writing Guidelines for Technical Documentation

## 1. Document Structure

**Hierarchical headings:** Use clear H1 (title), H2 (major sections), and H3 (subsections)

**Intro section:** Begin with a brief overview explaining what the section covers

**Practical examples:** Include real-world scenarios or use cases

**Supporting visuals:** Integrate diagrams/screenshots to clarify complex concepts

## 2. Tone & Language

**Professional but accessible:** Write for technical practitioners who may not be experts in this domain

**Active voice:** Prefer "Configure the settings" over "The settings should be configured"

**Clear terminology:** Define or link to definitions of specialized terms on first use

**Avoid jargon unless necessary:** When technical terms are essential, explain them briefly

## 3. Content Patterns

### Key Concepts Section

- Define core terms related to the topic
- Use bullet points for quick scanning
- Include brief explanations (1-2 sentences each)
- Example: "Authentication: The process of verifying user identity through credentials or tokens..."

### How-To / Implementation Sections

- Use numbered steps for sequential processes
- Begin steps with action verbs (Verify, Configure, Select, Install, etc.)
- Bold UI elements and settings: "Navigate to **Settings**"
- Include expected outcomes after each step or group of steps

### Best Practices / Considerations

- Use subsections like "Important considerations:" or "Best practices:"
- Present information as bulleted lists
- Link to related documentation
- Highlight common mistakes or edge cases

## 4. Formatting Standards

| Element            | Style                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Button/UI elements | Bold text (e.g., **Save**, **Next Step**)                      |
| Field names        | Code formatting or bold (e.g., `user_id` or **Email Address**) |
| Emphasis           | Bold for important concepts, italics for terms being defined   |
| Lists              | Bullet points for non-sequential info; numbered for processes  |
| Code/API           | Monospace formatting                                           |
| Links              | Inline hyperlinks with descriptive anchor text                 |

## 5. Visual Documentation Standards

**Diagrams:** Use for showing data flow, relationships, or architecture

**Screenshots:** Include when showing UI navigation

**Annotations:** Label key elements in images

**Captions:** Provide brief, descriptive captions for all visuals

## 6. Information Architecture

**Front-load critical info:** Place most important concepts first

**Progressive disclosure:** Start with basics, move to advanced topics

**Cross-references:** Link to related sections and external documentation

**Table of contents:** Include for longer documents

## 7. Example/Use Case Patterns

When including examples:

- State the scenario clearly
- Show the configuration/data structure or code sample
- Explain the result or expected behavior
- Include both successful and edge-case examples

## 8. Consistency Standards

**Product/project naming:** Use consistent terminology throughout

**Tense:** Use present tense for instructional content

**Spelling:** Follow standard American English

**Abbreviations:** Define on first use, then use consistently

## 9. Technical Accuracy

**Version-specific info:** Note if content applies to specific versions or releases

**Deprecation notices:** Highlight outdated practices with clear warnings

**Real-world constraints:** Mention limits, quotas, or known issues

**Validation:** Explain what constitutes valid input/configuration

## 10. Accessibility & Readability

**Paragraph length:** Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences maximum

**Sentence length:** Aim for 15-20 words per sentence

**White space:** Use generous spacing between sections

**Scanability:** Use headings and bold text to allow quick scanning

## Quick Style Checklist

- ☐ Clear, hierarchical structure with descriptive headings
- ☐ Technical terms defined or linked on first use
- ☐ Practical examples or use cases included
- ☐ Step-by-step instructions use numbered lists with action verbs
- ☐ UI elements and code are formatted appropriately
- ☐ Related documentation is cross-referenced
- ☐ Visual content (diagrams/screenshots) supports text
- ☐ Information is front-loaded by importance
- ☐ Consistent terminology throughout
- ☐ Readability optimized with short paragraphs and varied sentence structure
